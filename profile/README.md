## Hi there 👋

Welcome to our Hackathon team's GitHub page! 🚀

### 🙋‍♂️ Who are we?
We're a dynamic team participating in a hackathon, focused on implementing a groundbreaking idea using zkSNARK to create zkKYC (zero-knowledge Know Your Customer) solutions. Our mission is to enhance privacy and security in digital identities.

### 🍿 Fun Facts
During hackathons, our team's breakfast of choice is a mix of coffee, energy bars, and the occasional pizza — fuel for our coding marathons!

----
Remember, the journey of a thousand lines of code begins with a single commit. Happy coding! 🌟
